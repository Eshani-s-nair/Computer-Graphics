# 🎨 Computer Graphics Programs (OpenGL)

This repository contains a collection of **Computer Graphics programs** implemented using **OpenGL** in Python .  
Each folder focuses on a particular concept in computer graphics — from basic shape drawing to geometric transformations and creative animations.

## 📂 Folder Structure

| Folder | Description |
|:--------|:-------------|
| **Basics/** | Contains programs for drawing **basic shapes** such as lines, circles, triangles, and quadrilaterals using OpenGL primitives. |
| **line-drawing/** | Implements various **line drawing algorithms** such as DDA and Bresenham’s algorithms for efficient pixel-based rendering. |
| **circle-drawing/** | Includes programs for **circle generation algorithms**, including Bresenham’s circle algorithm and the midpoint circle algorithm. |
| **Rotation/** | Demonstrates **rotation transformations** on 2D objects using transformation matrices and OpenGL rotation functions. |
| **Translation/** | Contains programs that perform **translation transformations**, moving objects to new positions in the coordinate system. |
| **Scaling/** | Implements **scaling operations** that change the size of objects relative to a fixed point or origin. |
| **animation/** | This folder contains several **basic and intermediate animations** built using OpenGL. The programs include examples such as a bouncing ball, a swinging pendulum, a rotating fan, and even a creative “man drawing water from a well” animation. Along with these, the folder also features a few other animated scenes that demonstrate motion, timing, and transformation concepts in computer graphics. |
